# Hacktech 2021 - Terra
Created by Eileen Li, Lucy Gao, Rupa Kurinchi-Vendhan, and Theresa Zhang

Terra is an app created for users to monitor their carbon footprint. It includes:
- a diagnostic quiz for users to gauge their beginning impact on our environment :pencil:
- carbon footprint percentage results :thought_balloon:
- an overall status rating based on results :+1: :-1:
- goal-oriented tasks to guide the user in living greener :seedling:

## Inspiration
We wanted to create something that could be used by anyone. We each need to do our part in helping save our planet, and being mindful of our carbon footprint is an easy way to begin doing so. However, this may seem complicated and rather daunting, so we wanted to present a simple solution where a user can figure out their carbon footprint and find ways to reduce it quickly and with ease.

## What it does
The app initially gives the user a diagnostic quiz and calculates a carbon footprint score based off of his or her responses. Ways to reduce the user's carbon footprint will be suggested, and as users complete these goals, their scores will be reduced.

## How we built it
Rupa was in charge of the front-end code, which included layout and the diagnostic quiz. Theresa came up with the user's goals and figured out how to handle the code for them. Lucy and Eileen came up with the questions for the diagnostic test and computed all of the score calculations. We met to discuss issues that we couldn't resolve by ourselves and to keep each other updated with what we were doing.

## Challenges we ran into
Originally we tried to write our back-end code in Python, having assumed we could link it up easily with the Javascript front-end. However, we couldn't find a way to make it compatible with JavaScript, so we had to convert everything from Python to Javascript. There were also certain design decisions that were hard to make, such as what the best way to manage the tasks were, and how to handle how the percentages calculated would be reduced when tasks were completed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The app itself looks amazing. We were able to work cohesively as a team and successfully overcome any roadblocks we encountered.

## What we learned
How to use JavaScript, mainly. Most of us are more familiar with Java, Python, and C, so using JavaScript was a new experience.
